# Final ROM

Final ROM is an all-in-one offline utility for working with your retro and
console game ROMs. Everything runs locally on your device. There are no
accounts, no servers, and no internet connection required.

## Features

- **3DS (.3ds / CCI)** - Decrypt and re-encrypt 3DS ROMs.
- **Switch** - Compress and decompress NSP/NSZ and XCI/XCZ files, and merge or
  unmerge multi-content packages.
- **CHD** - Compress disc images to CHD and extract them back.
- **Patching** - Apply ROM patches in common formats, including IPS, UPS, BPS,
  APS, PPF, EBP, DPS, and xdelta.
- **Hashing** - Verify your files with checksum hashing.

## How it works

You pick a file, choose an operation, and Final ROM processes it directly on
your device. By default the original file is left untouched and a new output
file is written next to it. The heavy work runs in the background so the app
stays responsive.

## Important notes

- You are responsible for the ROMs and files you process. Only use Final ROM
  with content you legally own.
- Final ROM does not include, distribute, or download any game files or
  encryption keys. You must supply your own.

## Platforms

Final ROM currently builds and runs on Android, iOS, and Windows. It does not
run in a web browser, because it works with local files.

## Building and running

Final ROM is a Flutter app with native FFI plugins (`chdman_ffi`, `xdelta3_ffi`,
`zstd_ffi`) for CHD, xdelta, and Zstandard support. Their native sources are
already vendored in `final_rom/packages/`, so a normal Flutter build picks
them up automatically.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (stable channel),
  matching the Dart SDK constraint in `pubspec.yaml`.
- A C/C++ toolchain and CMake, for the native FFI plugins.

From the `final_rom/` directory, fetch dependencies once:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### Android

Requires Android Studio (or just the Android SDK/NDK and command-line tools).

```sh
flutter run -d android      # debug
flutter build apk           # release APK
```

### iOS

Requires a Mac with Xcode and CocoaPods installed.

```sh
flutter run -d ios          # debug
flutter build ios           # release build 
```

### Windows

Requires Visual Studio (with the "Desktop development with C++" workload).

```sh
flutter run -d windows      # debug
flutter build windows       # release build, output under build/windows/
```

### Linux

Requires CMake, ninja-build, clang, and GTK 3 development headers (the
usual [Flutter Linux desktop prerequisites](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/desktop)).

```sh
flutter run -d linux      # debug
flutter build linux       # release build
```

`chdman_ffi` and `zstd_ffi` already have Linux build files, but
`xdelta3_ffi` does not, so xdelta patching would need additional native
build setup on this platform.

### macOS

Requires a Mac with Xcode and CocoaPods installed.

```sh
flutter run -d macos      # debug
flutter build macos       # release build
```

`chdman_ffi` and `zstd_ffi` already have macOS build files, but
`xdelta3_ffi` does not, so xdelta patching would need additional native
build setup on this platform.

## Credits and acknowledgments

Final ROM builds on the work of several open source projects:

- **[MAME](https://mamedev.org)** - the `chd` source used to create and
  extract CHD disc images.
- **[UniPatcher](https://github.com/btimofeev/UniPatcher)** (btimofeev and
  contributors) - the ROM patcher module (IPS, UPS, BPS, APS, PPF, EBP, DPS,
  xdelta dispatch, and checksum helpers) is ported from UniPatcher's Kotlin/Java
  sources.
- **[NSZ](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz)** (Nico Bosshard / nicoboss) - the
  Switch NSZ/NCZ compression logic is modeled on the reference NSZ Python
  implementation.
- **[xdelta](https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta)** (Joshua MacDonald) - the
  xdelta3 delta-compression library used for xdelta patches.
- **[b3DS](https://github.com/b1k/b3DS)** (b1k and DemonKingSwarn) - the
  3DS decryption/encryption logic is ported from the b3DSDecrypt/b3DSEncrypt
  scripts.
