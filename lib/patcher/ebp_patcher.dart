/// EBP (EarthBound Patch) patcher. Ported from UniPatcher's `EBP.java`.
///
/// An EBP file is, structurally, an IPS patch (it carries the "PATCH" magic and
/// the same record format). UniPatcher additionally performs EarthBound-specific
/// "clean ROM" preparation — stripping the SNES SMC header and repairing known
/// bad dumps via bundled IPS assets keyed by MD5. That repair is specific to a
/// single SNES game and depends on assets we do not ship, so it is intentionally
/// not ported here; we validate the EBP header and apply it as an IPS patch.
